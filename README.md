# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

This is a product preview card made as a part of the Frontend Mentor challenges.(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)
It made with the help of HTML and CSS. The product card basically displays the details about the specified product
such as price , name and description. 
It also has a button which can allow users to buy the product if convinced.
The product card has been made keeping in mind the responsiveness of the page as well. Desktop and mobile both have been considered.
